### English:

👋 Hi, I'm a second-year student majoring in Computer Science and Networking. I'm passionate about technology, coding, and exploring new ways to solve problems. As I continue to learn and grow, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences with others.

📚 My journey into the world of **Cloud Computing & Operations**, **Python**, **Cursor**, and **Containerization** has been exciting and full of learning. Every day, I dive deeper into areas like cloud infrastructure, server management, automation, container orchestration, and more. I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and through this repository, I want to document my progress and help others who are on a similar path.

📝 This repository is not only a space for my personal study notes but also a place where I share the projects I’m working on, coding challenges I solve, and thoughts I have as I learn. Whether it's a new concept I've mastered, a bug I've fixed, or an interesting project I'm developing, you'll find it all here!

🎮 In addition to coding and learning, I also enjoy building simple games and fun projects in my spare time. If you're interested in any of the projects I’ve shared, feel free to reach out or contribute!

🌱 I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing. This repository is meant to be a community of learners and creators, where we can all grow together. I look forward to connecting with other like-minded individuals, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on exciting projects.
